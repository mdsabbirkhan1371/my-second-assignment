                <h2><span class="partial-color">Barcelona</span></h2>
                <p>On October 22, 1899, Hans Kamper placed an advertisement in a local newspaper claiming his wish to
                    form a
                    football club; a few positive
                    answers led to a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on November 29th. Eleven players attended, led by Joan
                    Gamper.
                    FC Barcelona was created.

                    The club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism through the years, with the motto
                    "Més
                    que un
                    club" (More than a club).

                    Joan Gamper, founder of FC Barcelona

                    The club has long been controversial due to its revolutionary spirit during both Primo de Rivera´s
                    and
                    Francisco Franco´s dictatorships. The symbols born by the club as well as its identity clearly show
                    the
                    catalán nationalism.</p>

                <p>Since they were founded in 1892, the Liverpool Football Club name was synonymous with fame and glory.
                    Internationally, Liverpool is the most successful British club of all time with plenty of European
                    trophies on their record. They are one of the most popular football teams in the world, with over
                    200
                    supporter clubs in at least 50 different countries. And yet, their magnificent history will forever
                    be
                    plagued by two of the worst stadium disasters of all time: Heysel and Hillsborough.</p>

                <p>Manchester United is one of the most prestigious football clubs and has always maintained a
                    distinguished
                    tradition, a record of consistent success, and a great history. They are together with Liverpool,
                    England's most successful football clubs ever. "The Red Devils" have more national titles than
                    Liverpool, but the rival has collected more titles in international tournaments.</p>
